        <p>There is a quill basket that looks awesome. It is most likely to have been made by a man about 500–700 years ago, a man most likely hunted a porcupine, then took the quills off. When he got them, his wife weaved it and painted it to make a quill basket with a painting of an eagle.</p>

        <p>Arrowheads are one of the earliest Native American tools. About 14,000 years ago, Native American tribes made them out of flint and stone. They did it by scraping a rock until it was sharp on all sides. Then they attached it to a stick and used it as an arrow. The sharp part made it easy to hunt prey. The arrow heads are triangle shaped and the spear heads are shaped like christmas trees. Then it was discovered thousands of years later.</p>

        <p>Fur was very helpful for Native Americans. They used fur for clothing, to wrap up babies and little kids, and for warm winter wear. Most of the time, women and girls would make the clothes while the men and boys caught the animals. They removed the fur by skinning the animals.</p>

        <p>Native Americans used plant fibers and animal tissues to make fishing nets. They used quivers to protect the animal tissues, but they used plant fibers more often. They placed a heavy stone somewhere in the net so it would sink into the water. Sometimes children helped make the nets and were rewarded for their work.</p>

        <p>The turtle rattle is an interesting item that many people wonder about. How is it made? Why is it important? In this story, you will learn about the turtle rattle.</p>
        <p>The turtle rattle is an artifact mostly made by Native American culture. It is used during festivals, like Thanksgiving, and played like jingle bells at Christmas. They are used in cultural songs.</p>
        <p>Drums are also played at festivals. The turtle rattle is basically like a maraca but made from a full turtle shell. Inside the rattle, they put seeds and rocks. To play it, you simply shake it like a maraca.</p>
        <p>There are even baby toys that use beads to rattle. So next time you see a turtle, think back to the Native Americans.</p>

        <p>The Native American symbols are a visual language built with ideas of courage and nature. Some of these symbols include eagles, bears, and camps. These symbols were used for storytelling, communicating, and more.</p>
        <p>Something most people don’t know is that instead of writing left to right, these symbols were sometimes written in a spiral that starts at the edge and ends in the middle. We do not know if there was a certain age when someone had to learn this writing style, but many learned from elders through storytelling, observing adults, and practicing.</p>
        <p>One of the most important symbols was the eagle, which meant curiosity and strength. So if you think reading emojis is hard, think about what these people had to learn!</p>

        <p>In addition to providing musical accompaniment, drums were used as a form of long-distance communication. A sort of "Morse code" system was used, which was different for every tribe. Since the signals produced were kept secret within a particular tribe, drumming can be seen as a very secure form of communication.</p>

        <p>Native American pottery is considered a significant art form and a vital part of the cultural heritage of Native American people. The history of Native American pottery dates back approximately 2,500 years, with its origins in the Southwestern region of the United States.</p>
        <p>In fact, Native American pottery history spans at least 7,500 years, with early examples appearing around 3000 BC in what is now Georgia. Originally a necessity for cooking and storage, pottery traditions developed independently across North America, with distinct regional styles and techniques, such as the hand-coiling method still used today.</p>

They made their clothing from animal hides, such as deer or buffalo, and decorated them with beads, feathers, and shells. Each tribe had its own style, which could show where a person came from or their role in the community. These clothes were often worn during ceremonies and dances, with special designs and colors that had meanings or told stories. Their clothing was both practical and a beautiful expression of their traditions and way of life.</p>

        <p>Native Americans used baskets for many important purposes in their daily lives. They made baskets from natural materials like reeds, grasses, and bark to collect, carry, and store food such as berries, nuts, and grains. Some baskets were woven so tightly that they could even hold water for cooking. The designs on the baskets often had special meanings, showing stories of nature, or tribal symbols. Besides being useful, baskets were also used in trade, given as gifts, and held deep spiritual meaning, connecting the people to nature and their traditions.</p>
